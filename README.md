# MCP Copilot Text Manager

**Beta** - Efficient copy/cut/paste tools for GitHub Copilot agents. Reduces token usage by moving existing code instead of regenerating it.

## Features
- 📋 **Copy** text with source tracking
- ✂️ **Cut** text with precise positioning  
- 📝 **Paste** directly into files
- 📚 **History** of all operations
- 🎯 **Character-level precision**

## Installation

### 1. Build the MCP Server
```bash
cd src
npm install
npm run build
```

### 2. Configure VS Code
Add to your MCP settings (`mcp.json`):
```json
{
  "servers": {
    "text-manager": {
      "command": "node",
      "args": ["C:/path/to/mcp-copilot-text-manager/build/index.js"]
    }
  }
}
```

### 3. Restart VS Code
The tools will be available as `@agent copy`, `@agent cut`, `@agent paste` in GitHub Copilot Chat.

## Usage
```
@agent copy the Dog class from sauce.py
@agent cut lines 10-25 from target.py  
@agent paste the copied code to line 50 in main.py
```

**Note**: Line changes are not visually highlighted in GitHub Copilot Chat like they are in VS Code. To see the actual file modifications, use git version control commands (`git diff`, `git status`) to track changes. The affected line numbers are displayed in the command output for reference.

*Visual diff highlighting in Copilot Chat is planned for a future release.*

## Why Use This?
- **Token Efficient**: Move code instead of regenerating
- **Preserves Context**: Tracks source file and line numbers
- **Precise**: Character-level positioning for surgical edits
- **Safe**: Maintains clipboard history for recovery
